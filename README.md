## 📦 Project Overview

This project trains an image classifier that can recognize 150+ Pokémon characters from images. It uses **MobileNetV2** as a pretrained base and adds a custom head for Pokémon classification.

Trained using **TensorFlow + Keras**, with **data augmentation**, **fine-tuning**, and **early stopping** for best performance.
